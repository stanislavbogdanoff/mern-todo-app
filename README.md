## About

TodoTracker allows you to authorize and save todos. Todos are displayed as a table (on mobile as cards) with number, time, text, status.  You can edit, delete and mark the todos as done or not done. Your stats such as completed and active todos are displayed on the top with a Doughnut Chart

TodoTracker was developed based on Travesy Media's series [Learn the MERN stack](https://youtu.be/-0exw-9YJBo), but the functionality was modified. 

Particularly, status, editablity and the stats chart were added; Frontend was heavily altered as well.

## Functionality

- Register and Login
- Enter a todo
- Mark the todo as done or not done
- Edit the todo 
- Delete the todo
- See the active and completed todos in different tables
- Check your stats on a Dougnut Chart

## Future Development

Might add deadline feature with todos being marked failed automatically if the deadline is missed.

Other than that project is completely done.
